# Using recursion to solve sudoku.
# Function search for an empty point then tries all values between (1,9), if suitable
# value found, it replaces point with value and calls a new solve. If a solve returns
# it means that there is no suitable value for the point, therefore previous point
# assignment is false because the next point can't be found.Program returns to  previous
# solve and replace point with 0 (empty) and search for a new possible value.
# If a new suitable value founds a new solve called otherwise current solve return too
# and previous point is reassigned.
# Function works until all grid is solved.then prints solved grid
